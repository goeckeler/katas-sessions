This aims to become an environment for running [Mia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mia_%28game%29) games, where the players are bots programmed by participants in an exercise session.

The game is run by a server (provided here). The players communicate with that server using a simple text-based protocol over UDP.

The idea for this was shamelessly copied from Nicolas Botzet and Steven Collins, who used a similar setup (albeit simulating Poker) for their [Craftsmen Coding Contest session at SoCraTes 2011](http://socrates2011.pbworks.com/w/page/44002190/Sessions).
